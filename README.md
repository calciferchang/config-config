basic dotfile repo that contains:

- .zshrc
- .gitconfig
- Wezterm config
- Helix config
- Yazi config (along with an integration in Helix)
- and some scripts to set up the aforementioned

TODO:
- [ ] add LSPs to the setup/install script
- [ ] have the script check what's installed before executing
